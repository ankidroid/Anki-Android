| I lost my decks! | Hello NAME. Sorry about the inconvenience. Fortunately, AnkiDroid makes regular backups, so chances are you can recover your decks. Please have a look at http://ankidroid.org/docs/manual.html#backups and if you still have problems send a message to the mailing list at public-forum@ankidroid.org. Thanks for your patience! |

| You can't change any options | AnkiDroid is designed to show you the cards just before you forget them, in order to minimize wasted study time. If the default settings are not working well for you, you can adjust the intervals under "deck options". If you simply want to study more than necessary, it's better to use the "custom study" feature. Please see the manual for more info. |
