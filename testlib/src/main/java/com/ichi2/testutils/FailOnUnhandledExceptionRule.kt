/**
 * (#16253) Under unit tests, ACRA may infinitely loop when trying to handle an unhandled exception
 *
 * The default test behavior is to suppress an exception
 *
 * This rule replaces both UsageAnalytics and ACRA, ensuring a failure is reported
 *
 * When applying this rule, it SHOULD be applied after Application.onCreate, otherwise the exception
 * handlers will override it
 *
 * This is not validated as `@Config(application = EmptyApplication::class)` is a valid
 * use case where `exceptionHandler` is null
