# We want control over the SDK used to build since we need newer JDKs
# Use the latest LTS supported by temurin with version format xx.yy.zz-tem (ignore sub-version)
# You may find versions e.g. for JDK21 like so https://adoptium.net/temurin/archive/?version=21
# You may verify that a JDK is installed by looking at the "sdk list java" output from, for example:
# https://jitpack.io/com/github/ankidroid/Anki-Android/v2.18alpha7/build.log (just use a recent tag,
# if it has not built yet you will have to wait for it to build then on refresh the build log should exist)
before_install:
    - sdk update
    - sdk list java
    - sdk install java 21.0.2-tem
    - sdk use java 21.0.2-tem

# We can do the absolute minimum to build the API module, no need to build AnkiDroid module
install:
    - ./gradlew :api:publishToMavenLocal
