# Introduction
AnkiDroid is [free (open source) software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and is run entirely by volunteers. This page contains information on how you can contribute back to the AnkiDroid project.

Here are some links to other pages related to contributing to AnkiDroid:
* [[Development guide|Development-Guide]]
* [Alpha/beta testing](http://ankidroid.org/manual.html#betaTesting)

# Answer questions on the forum
Providing support for users can place a significant burden on the developers, so one of the easiest ways that you can contribute back to AnkiDroid is by regularly answering questions that you know the answer to [on the forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/anki-android).

# Rate AnkiDroid
Hearing positive feedback is a motivation booster for all involved, and a better rating means more people using AnkiDroid and sharing decks.

# Translate AnkiDroid

* See [[Translating-AnkiDroid]]



# Take screenshots
For each language we need:
  * A few screenshots on a normal phone (review with image, review with sound, card edition, deck list)
  * At least one screenshot on a ~7inch screen
  * At least one screenshot on a ~10inch screen

Here are all screenshots we have, so you can see which ones are missing:
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/tree/main/docs/marketing/screenshots

Send the images to the [forum](http://groups.google.com/group/anki-android) so that we can use them to improve the Play Store page, the Wiki, etc.

You can download various shared decks to show nice content. To take a screenshot, press the "Power" and "Volume down" buttons simultaneously.
You can use the emulator if you don't have any 7inch or 10inch device.

To take screenshots for several languages, you can switch the AnkiDroid UI language in Preferences as explained above.

# Other Non-developer tasks
  * Send us your ManualTesting results about the alphas/betas.
  * **Blog** about AnkiDroid and spread the word :-)
  * Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/AnkiDroid) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/AnkiDroid).
  * Here is a **[list of tasks](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ANondeveloper)** that can be done by people who can't code.

# Sponsor development
In case you are willing to pay money for a feature or fix to be implemented, here is how you can do it:

* Find the issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues), or create a new issue if it does not exist yet. 

* Add as many details as you can, describe how it could work, draw a prototype on paper, etc.

* Post a comment asking "If I provide a good quality patch for this feature, will it be merged?" and wait for our answer.

* Choose someone to do the job. Use any crowdsourcing platform you trust (for example [bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/)), or a developer friend, or a software company. Make sure they know Android and Git.

* Reach an agreement with the developer:

* Agree with the developer on the conditions, defining exactly what they must implement.

* Insist that produced source code must be released as Open Source (not doing so would be a breach of the GNU-GPLv3 license). A common error would be to ask only for the binary APK (which will quickly get out-of-date and incompatible)

If possible, make it a condition that produced source code must be merged by us before total payment. Or make it half/half. If the issue is Enhancement-Critical or Defect-High or Defect-Critical, then the developer can be assured that we will merge it fast, if the code is good enough.

Propose to become a tester if they need. Giving your feedback early could help. Be sure to test on different devices and in different scenarios.

# Crash reporting system
It's sometimes possible for core and non-core developers to help with troubleshooting an error by looking at crash reports. You can [find Crash Reports details here](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Crash-Reports)

| It continuously crashes! | Hello NAME, sorry for the inconvenience! You can try uninstalling and re-installing as this often fixes such bugs. If not, please report the problem at https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/new , including as many details as possible (Android version, device, steps that lead to the problem) and we'll look into it. Thanks for using AnkiDroid! |
| How can I do X? (already in the manual) | Hello NAME, thanks for your feedback! Please read the corresponding section of the manual at ankidroid.org/manual.html#ENTRY and see if that answers your question. Thanks for using AnkiDroid! |
| There is a problem with X (already in tracker) | Hello NAME, thanks for your feedback! This problem is being investigated at TRACKERURL , please check whether it matches what you mean, and "star" that page to receive notifications. Thanks for using AnkiDroid!|
| There is a problem with X (not in tracker) | Hello NAME, thanks for your feedback! Please report the problem at https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/new , including as many details as possible (Android version, device, steps that lead to the problem). Thanks for using AnkiDroid! |
| You should add feature X (already in tracker) | Hello NAME, thanks for your idea! This idea is debated at TRACKERURL , please check whether it matches what you mean, and "star" that page to receive notifications. Thanks for participating in AnkiDroid! |
| You should add feature X (not in tracker) | Hello NAME, thanks for your idea! Please suggest it at https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/new  so that volunteers can see it and keep track of it. Thanks for participating in AnkiDroid!|
| I lost my decks! | Hello NAME. Sorry about the inconvenience. Fortunately, AnkiDroid makes regular backups, so chances are you can recover your decks. Please have a look at http://ankidroid.org/docs/manual.html#backups and if you still have problems send a message to the mailing list at public-forum@ankidroid.org. Thanks for your patience! |
| I lost my decks (Japanese) | NAME様、ご連絡いただきありがとうございます。バックアップから元に戻す可能性がございますので、なるべく早くメーリングリストへご連絡していただけないでしょうか。アドレスはankidroid-nihon@googlegroups.comです。よろしくお願い致します。|
| You can't change any options | AnkiDroid is designed to show you the cards just before you forget them, in order to minimize wasted study time. If the default settings are not working well for you, you can adjust the intervals under "deck options". If you simply want to study more than necessary, it's better to use the "custom study" feature. Please see the manual for more info. |
| Some characters don't show | Hello, It is likely that your Android device does not support those specific characters in its default font. If that's the case you can use a custom font instead: https://ankidroid.org/docs/manual.html#customFonts|
