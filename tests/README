This directory contains tests and a test project for AnkiDroid.

You can import this project into Eclipse as you did for the main project. You
can also run the tests from the command line with:

  ant clean debug test

Make sure you have installed a version of the application that you have build before running the test. You can do some from the command line with:

  cd ..
  ant clean debug install
  cd tests


The output of the tests should look something like:

test:
     [echo] Running tests ...
     [exec]
     [exec] com.ichi2.utils.HtmlUtilTest:......
     [exec] Test results for InstrumentationTestRunner=......
     [exec] Time: 0.058
     [exec]
     [exec] OK (6 tests)
     [exec]
     [exec]

assuming all the tests are passing.

The test classes and the number of tests is subject to change.
