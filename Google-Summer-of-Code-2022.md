AnkiDroid has applied to participate in [Google Summer Of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)! GSoC is a global program which offers non-experienced contributors (and, historically, post-secondary students) the opportunity to discover and work with open-source organizations. The contributions are supported by a stipend. Contributors work closely with one or more mentors from an open-source organization to implement either a project idea by the organization, or a proposal of their own. You might be interested in our GSoC info pages from previous years: [2021](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2021)

In order to receive updates about GSoC at Ankidroid, please subscribe to the AnkiDroid GSoC Announce mailing list and join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qjzcRTx),

Also, please note that acceptance into GSoC isn't a prerequisite for becoming an AnkiDroid contributor. The AnkiDroid project is run by the community for the community, and We welcome any contributors, you can start contributing immediately if you desire so. For the sake of transparency, we are all [volunteers](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/OpenCollective-Payment-Process) here and if you participate now, it's as a volunteer, it does not guarantee, even implicitly, that you will be selected for GSoC.

## What is Google Summer of Code?
> Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

A: There is no specific minimum number. Remember that quality is more important than quantity. It is better to submit a non-trivial PR rather than a one-line wording change. Start with starter issues, then prioritize ones that touch the area(s) of the codebase which are related to your project.

**Q: I do not have any experience in skill XYZ. Is some certification required?**

A: Try to work on good first issues and take courses online. In the field of software development, it is common to develop experience and expertise as you take up and complete projects successfully. We do not require any formal certification of particular skills.

## Selection Criteria

In order to select contributors for GSoC, we will mainly be looking at three things:
* The quality of the submitted proposal
* The quality of the applicant's previously-submitted PRs (in order to assess their ability to code, debug, break down complex tasks, etc.). Note that quantity isn't a prerequisite in itself, though contributors who've submitted multiple PRs are likely to have had more opportunities to demonstrate the abilities needed to succeed in GSoC.
* Clear, unambiguous communication. (This is important; your proposal will be read by many mentors!)
* A proposed solution approach that is sufficiently concrete and which demonstrates that the applicant has a good understanding of both the scope of the problem and the existing codebase.

## AnkiDroid's Project Ideas List
The following is a list of Ankidroid's 2022 GSoC project ideas. You are welcome to choose among these ideas, or propose your own! However, if you're planning to propose something original, it's essential to engage with the AnkiDroid community beforehand in order to get feedback and guidance to improve the proposal. We'd also recommend taking a look at AnkiDroid's mission and seeing if there is a natural way to tie your idea to the AnkiDroid project's goals, otherwise it might not be a good fit at this time.

Please note that the list of project ideas below is not set in stone: more projects may be added later, and some project descriptions may also change a bit, so check back regularly. In addition, the mentor assignments listed below are provisional, and may change depending on which proposals are eventually accepted.
