Recently, when I saved the card, I got stuck for a long time. I even went to the official website to download the latest version, but it was still stuck. When saving the card, the experience is not as smooth as before, and the experience is not good! Furthermore, even when reviewing the cards, it will get stuck. It's like a slow response. It's not like losing frames when playing a game. It's just that kind of unsmooth feeling. I don't know why. This has appeared in the last two days, and the usage process is exactly the same as before.
