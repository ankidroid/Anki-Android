Non-Android-Specific Issues :: AnkiDroid (the Android version of Anki) is created and managed independently from other Anki versions. For the PC / Web / iOS versions, and general Anki issues that are not limited to Android, please visit the main https://anki.tenderapp.com/[Anki support site].

Bug Reports and Feature Requests :: For bug reports and feature requests, please search through the current list of open issues on the https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues[AnkiDroid issue tracker],
