NOTE:

Opt-in / off-by-default crash reporting will send data to a private / AnkiDroid open source team controlled crash reporting server if enabled. This data is only used to help fix crash bugs.

Opt-in / off-by-default analytics will send data to Google Analytics via an an open-source implementation of the analytics API if enabled. This data is only used to focus developer efforts on popular features.
