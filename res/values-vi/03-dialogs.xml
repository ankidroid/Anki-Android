  <string name="studyoptions_welcome_dialog">AnkiDroid helps you to learn whatever you want. You can create your own flashcards and study them or download packages of other users. AnkiDroid helps you to decide when to recapitulate facts; it shows you the flashcards just before you will forget them.\n\nTo get a first impression of how things work, we recommend you to start with the tutorial deck which will give you some initial information and try a bit out. Just just click on \"Start Reviewing\" after having opened it.\n\nOpen tutorial deck now?</string>
