# Using custom fonts with AnkiDroid

The Anki version 2.0+ supports custom fonts in a way that is compatible with both the desktop and mobile apps (including AnkiDroid).

See the [AnkiDroid manual](http://ankidroid.org/manual.html#customFonts) for more info

**Note**: Generally you should prefer the method described in the link above, as it is better documented and likely to work in most cases.

**Note**: This feature is supported on Froyo (Android 2.2) and later, but it is not supported on Eclair (Android 2.1).

A previous method for using custom fonts is described at AnkiDroid07CustomFonts and still works in AnkiDroid 2.x, but the version above is the currently supported one.
