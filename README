AnkiDroid: Anki on Android

Starting from 10th November 2014, the project has been configured to work "out of the box" with Android Studio.

After forking and cloning the Anki-Android git repository, open Android Studio, choose "Open Project", and then select the folder which you cloned the github repository to. The project should start without error, and build automatically.
