These crashes will contain information about your device and the current AnkiDroid configuration settings, and is used to troubleshoot and fix errors with the program.

At your option, and only after you grant permission, AnkiDroid may collect and transmit application usage information to Google Analytics. This may include information about your device and AnkiDroid configuration, and informs the developers which features are being used, and how they are being used, in order to focus limited developer time on features people care about enough to use. The service is configured in such a way that the data is not then re-shared with Google or any others, and is as anonymous as is possible by configuration in the Analytics settings.
