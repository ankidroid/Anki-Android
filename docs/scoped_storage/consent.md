We should inform the users:

* The driving force is privacy
* Uninstalling before migration will disable `preserveLegacyExternalStorage` and they will need to perform a manual migration
  * Just tell them not to uninstall
* Syncing will temporarily be disabled
* Uninstalling during the process may cause data loss
* Uninstalling after the process will delete all data instead of just settings
* How long this will take

We should obtain explicit consent:

* Since we are moving files, this puts data itegrity at (low) risk
* To reduce issues from users uninstalling

We may inform users:

* Syncing and importing will be much faster
* The new location of storage
* USB access only
