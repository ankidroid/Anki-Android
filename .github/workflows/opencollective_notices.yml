                      If you are interested in compensation for this work, the process with details is here:

                      https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/OpenCollective-Payment-Process#how-to-get-paid

                      We only post one comment per person per month to avoid spamming you, regardless of the number of PRs merged, but this note applies to all PRs merged for this month

                      Please note that GSoC contributions are okay for this process. Our philosophy is that our users have donated to AnkiDroid for all contributions. The only PRs that will not go through the OpenCollective process are ones directly related to am accepted GSoC project from a selected participant, since those receive a stipend from GSoC itself.

                      Please understand that our monthly budget is never guaranteed to cover all claims - the cap on payments-per-person may be lower, but we try to make our process as fair and transparent as possible, we just need your understanding.

                      Thanks!`
