# Workflows

GitHub Actions is used to automate parts of our development workflow.

See https://docs.github.com/en/actions for more information.

## Quality Checks

We run checks on all Pull Requests (PRs). We recommend that when appropriate, developers run the 
following scripts before submitting a PR.

Alternately, you may run the actions on your fork of `Anki-Android`.

## Other Workflows

These are typically run by maintainers. See the [Maintenance guide](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Maintenance-guide)

### Merge queue cancellation

GitHub can leave jobs running after their merge group has been removed.

`cancel_merge_queue_runs.yml` is triggered when a temporary merge queue branch is deleted.
The workflow cancels unfinished runs for unmerged groups.

### Automatic publish

An automatic alpha publish is performed every Monday at 04:30 UTC. This publish is skipped if:

* A publish occurred fewer than 7 UTC calendar days ago.
* The app is not in alpha.
* There were no commits since the last release.

An alpha published on Monday does not block the following Monday's release, regardless of the time it finished.
