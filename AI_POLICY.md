## AnkiDroid AI Tool Use Policy

We expect that contributors will provide a net benefit to AnkiDroid over time, in return we offer 
 mentorship and guidance.

AI generated contributions are nullifying our mentorship efforts by consuming guidance meant for 
 humans and shifting the responsibility of ensuring correctness onto our code reviewers.

This policy aims to:

* Ensure contributors can contribute without AI assistance.
* Provide reviewers with a framework to block contributions which do not benefit AnkiDroid.
* Ensure mentors are mentoring people, not AI output.

### New Contributors

Before you have 3 merged pull requests, you may **not** use any AI tools to produce contributions 
 for AnkiDroid.
This includes code, documentation, and GitHub comments (including spelling and grammar corrections).

If a reviewer suspects that **any** part of a contribution is produced with AI tools, a warning will
 be issued. Pull requests may be closed at the reviewer's discretion.

You may be banned from the repository if this occurs a second time.

### Contributors

* You **must** be able to explain all your contributions.
* AI tools **should not** be used to produce GitHub comments, including filling in the pull request 
  template.
* Contributions that make nontrivial use of AI tools **must** be labelled, with the tool version.

**Commit messages** **must** use the `Assisted-by:` 
 [git trailer](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers#_description) with an explanation
 of the contributions in the description.
