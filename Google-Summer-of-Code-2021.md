# Welcome!

Hello, all fantastic Google Summer of Code 2021 people!

## How we select our candidates

We created a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15JH_3YtfTatdA4V3tZ_lwBibRRyTSFbpeCjpzhX3-y0/edit?usp=sharing) explaining our selection process. Please fill this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wfbNhWL-SoDVIzTeJ-QhuCd5yBy4hF-3P6wENOU8a_w) and contact us for feedback.

## Timeline

Please observe the official timeline, if you are requesting things well before these dates, please take a breath and give us time, thank you

- March 29 - April 13 18:00 UTC: Students will submit their draft proposals through the program website for you to give solid feedback on.
- April 13 - May 2: Review all submitted student proposals with your org and consider how many you want to select and how many you can handle(ie how many you have committed mentors for). Decide on the minimum/maximum number of student slots to request- do not request more than your org can handle - this could take students away from orgs that have excellent student prospects and need the slots.
- May 3 18:00 UTC: Deadline to submit slot requests (Org Admins enter requests)

## Want to contribute to AnkiDroid before we officially start?

We welcome any contributors, and you can start contributing immediately if you desire so. For the sake of transparency, we are all [volunteers](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/OpenCollective-Payment-Process) here and if you participate now, it's as a volunteer, it does not guarantee, even implicitly, that you will be selected for GSoC.

You should look at our [Contributing](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Contributing) page and the list of [good first issues](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%21%22). If you work on an open issue, write down that you are working on it so that nobody else starts doing the same work as you. If you can't work on it anymore, please post another message to let us know. If you want to create your own feature, please post a feature request first so that the core contributors can confirm whether it would be accepted. 

There are a few tasks that will surely lead to accepted PR, assuming they are done correctly. Adding javadoc to class, members, and methods that are not yet properly documented, annotations such as `@Nullable`, `@NotNull`, and `@CheckResult` annotation. Of course, those annotations should be relevant. Also, increasing [coverage](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Development-Guide#code-coverage) is extremely welcomed, as it will considerably improve the future of the codebase.


## What is Google Summer of Code?
> [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open-source organization on a 10-week programming project during their break from school.
