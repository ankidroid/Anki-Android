# Welcome!

Hello, all fantastic Google Summer of Code 2021 people!

## Process

We are quite honest in the AnkiDroid project, so the first thing I will say is that I'm not sure what the best process should be! It is our first year at GSoC and we didn't expect so many interest. That's really cool, but experienced contributors need some day to discuss the best path forward. 

We have started receiving information from interested participants so we need a place to collect information so we don't lose it. We'll contact back everyone of you when we have decided more precisely. 

If you want to start participating, you may want to look at [Contributing](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Contributing) and the list of [good first issues](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%21%22). For the sake of transparency, we are all [volunteer](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/OpenCollective-Payment-Process) here and if you participate now, it's as a volunteer, it do not guarantee, even implicitly, that you'll be selected for GSoC.

So if you are an interested participant: Please add your **PUBLIC** contact information here in the list below. I emphasized "public" because this information will be web-scraped, used by spammers, etc. But we are an open-source project so there is no hiding your identity completely - but you should think carefully about what specific contact methods you share. 

## What is Google Summer of Code?
> [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 10 week programming project during their break from school.

## Timeline

Please observe the official timeline, if you are requesting things well before these dates, please take a breath and give us time, thank you

- March 29 - April 13 18:00 UTC: Students will submit their draft proposals through the program website for you to give solid feedback on.
- April 13 - May 2: Review all submitted student proposals with your org and consider how many you want to select and how many you can handle(ie how many you have committed mentors for). Decide on the minimum/maximum number of student slots to request- do not request more than your org can handle - this could take students away from orgs who have excellent student prospects and need the slots.
- May 3 18:00 UTC: Deadline to submit slot requests (Org Admins enter requests)
