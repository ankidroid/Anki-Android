Potential candidates should take a look at the guidelines on how to contribute to AnkiDroid.
- [Development Guide](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Development-Guide)
- [Contributing](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Contributing).
- [Code style](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Code-style)

## Process

We are quite honest in the AnkiDroid project, so the first thing I will say is that I'm not sure what the best process should be!

But we have started receiving information from interested participants, so we need a place to collect information, so we don't lose it.

So if you are an interested participant: Please add your **PUBLIC** contact information here in a list. 

I emphasized "public" because this information will be web-scraped, used by spammers, etc. But we are an open-source project, so there is no hiding your identity completely - but you should think carefully about what specific contact methods you share.
