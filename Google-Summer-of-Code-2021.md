# Welcome!

Hello, all fantastic Google Summer of Code 2021 people!

## Process

We are quite honest in the AnkiDroid project, so the first thing I will say is that I'm not sure what the best process should be!

But we have started receiving information from interested participants so we need a place to collect information so we don't lose it

So if you are an interested participant: Please add your **PUBLIC** contact information here in a list. 

I emphasized "public" because this information will be web-scraped, used by spammers etc etc. But we are an open source project so there is no hiding your identity completely - but you should think carefully about what specific contact methods you share.
