# Using a Zeemote controller

Starting with version 0.7 of AnkiDroid, users can now use the [Zeemote JS1 Controller](http://zeemote.com/) with AnkiDroid.  The benefit is that you can now review cards without needing to hold the phone or touch the screen.  This can be while jogging, for example, or to minimize strain on your hands/arms.  At least one user mentions using Zeemote while driving - we recommend to use extreme caution at all times while driving, whether using Anki or not.

## What is a Zeemote?
The Zeemote (formally known as the “Zeemote JS1 Bluetooth Gaming Controller”) is a Bluetooth device that can be used as an input or a remote control for your Android phone.  The Zeemote seems to be much more popular in Europe than in the US – I’m not sure how common it is in the rest of the world.   You should be able to find them for around 20 USD on eBay.  Note that they play up the functionality with Nokia phones online – but it is regular Bluetooth, so works with most if not all Android phones as well.

## Pairing the Zeemote to your phone
Steps will vary from phone to phone, but will typically be something like this...

From the Home screen, select Settings -> Wireless & Networks -> Bluetooth Settings -> Select the “Turn on Bluetooth” checkbox -> Turn on the Zeemote by holding down the "On" or "D" button on Zeemote (light starts flashing blue & yellow) -> Scan for Devices -> Wait for Zeemote JS1 to appear in phone -> select Zeemote JS1 -> Enter Key “0000” -> phone will say “Paired but not connected” -> exit back to home

## Setup AnkiDroid for Zeemote
Start AnkiDroid -> Start the Zeemote by holding the "D" button until the LED begins to flash (Zeemote will be flashing blue & yellow ) -> Preferences -> Navigation -> check the box for “Zeemote JS1 support”

## Use Zeemote with AnkiDroid
Select a deck to review -> Select Start Reviewing -> Select "Zeemote JS1" (Note that this step is only required the first time you use Zeemote with AnkiDroid, and is skipped after initial setup) -> Phone will display “Connecting to Zeemote JS1 This may take a few moments”  After a few moments, the Zeemote light will begin to flash blue only -> First question is displayed -> Select any of A, B, or D button to "Show Answer" -> Select appropriate button to grade the card.  A=Good; B=Again; D=Easy.

Here is a guide on where to find these buttons on the Zeemote itself: ![http://ankidroid.googlecode.com/files/Zeemote%20JS1%20Line%20Drawing%20with%20AnkiDroid%20notes.jpg](http://ankidroid.googlecode.com/files/Zeemote%20JS1%20Line%20Drawing%20with%20AnkiDroid%20notes.jpg)
