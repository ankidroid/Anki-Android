"Thanks for installing AnkiDroid!<br />This is a short introduction.<br />What you see now is the <span style='font-weight:600;'>question</span> part of a flashcard.<br />Please touch the large button below&hellip;<separator>&hellip; in order to see the <span style='font-weight:600;'>answer</span> part of the flashcard (below the line).<br />Touch the button on the right"
"The next card is shown now.<br />The idea is straightforward: Just like in &quot;real world&quot; paper flashcards, you write a question on the front and the answer on the back side of your cards.<br />(touch the button to show the back side)<separator>Let's assume you want to learn the world's capitals. Let the question be&hellip;<br />(touch one of the buttons to show the next card)"
"&quot;What is the capital of Burkina Faso?&quot;<br />Think a bit about the answer and then touch &quot;Show answer&quot;<separator>&quot;Ouagadougou&quot; is the right answer. <br />You didn't know it? Touch &quot;Again&quot; to see the card again in a couple of minutes. Otherwise, touch another button, depending on the easiness of the answer."
"Above every answer buttons, you find information about the time, after which the card will be shown again when answered by this button.<separator>This time period is calculated of the last time you answered the card, the current ease choice and ease choices of previous answers of that card."
"The intention is to show you the card again, immediately before you would forget it. Empirical studies have shown that by this means information can be learned most efficiently.<separator>If you want to learn more about spaced repetition, visit:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition_system"
"Some words about the organisation in AnkiDroid:<br /><br>All information has to be put into pairs of question and answer. If you want to learn in the other direction, you should create another card with swapped information.<separator>Don't worry, this can be done automatically. There's no need of inserting the same information twice."
"Cards're put together in decks and can there be organised by help of all sorts of tags.<separator>You will learn about that quickly when you start to use AnkiDroid."
"There're mainly two ways of getting new cards:<br />You either add premade decks of other users (in the decks list touch the circled plus at the top and  &quot;Get shared decks&quot;) or create them by yourself.<separator>You'll find thousands of premade decks to download,  some of them may be useful for you."
"But anyway, creating your own decks is essential to suit your needs perfectly. You can do this directly in AnkiDroid&hellip;<separator>&hellip; or (a bit more conveniently) with the desktop application Anki (downloadable for free under http://ankisrs.net/).<br><br>You can sync your decks with the desktop application very easily, so transfering the data isn't a problem."
"Let's have a look on the top bar:<br />In the left top corner you find some numbers. The blue one tells you, how many new cards are still projected for today. The red number counts the &quot;learning&quot; cards, those answered by &quot;again&quot; or seen for the first time today,<separator>the green one shows the number of cards you've already learned before and which are due to review today.<br />The type of the current cards is underlined."
"On the right corner you find information about your thinking time of this card and about your performance.<separator>The upper bar shows your progress, the lower one indicates the percentage of yes answers."
"Albeit you can use AnkiDroid stand alone, it's fully connected to AnkiWeb, the syncing server of Anki Desktop (available for Linux, Windows, Mac).<separator>Thus, you can easily sync your collection between AnkiDroid and Anki Desktop and use the latter for a more convenient card adding and managing."
"These have been the main points of AnkiDroid usage.<br /><br>For more information about the key concept of Anki, visit http://ankisrs.net/<separator>Just try it a bit out now and see, if it fits your needs.<br><br>Maybe start with the deck overview (hit menu on the main screen and choose &quot;all decks&quot;), where you can download premade decks or create your own (just use the menu there)."
