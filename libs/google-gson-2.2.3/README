Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert a Java object into its 
JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string into an 
equivalent Java object. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including 
pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.

Complete Gson documentation is available at its project page
