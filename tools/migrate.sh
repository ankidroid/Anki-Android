# * Select the Code > Convert Java File to Kotlin File functionality (or ctrl +
#   alt + shift + k),
# * When asked "Some code in the rest of your project may require corrections
#   after performing this conversion. Do you want to find such code and correct

# * Build the project (If you edited a test file, you must build the test),
