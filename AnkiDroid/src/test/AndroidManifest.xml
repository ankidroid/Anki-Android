        <!-- To use AndroidX Test APIs on Activity sub-classes, you must have valid
             Activity entries in your AndroidManifest. Manifest merger only happens with
             build variants, and tests always run with the debug build variant, so test-only
             Activity subclasses are defined here, and this file is included in debug.sourceSet
