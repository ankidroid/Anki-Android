DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE AUTO-COPIED BY GRADLE AT BUILD TIME

If you want to edit the files here, instead:

1) edit the files in testlib/src/java/com/ichi2/testutils/common
2) run `./gradlew copyTestLibIntoAndroidTest` or a general build

Then your edits in testlib should be copied here for use in androidTest

That gradle task, and this entire directory should be removed when
issue https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/332746900 is fixed
