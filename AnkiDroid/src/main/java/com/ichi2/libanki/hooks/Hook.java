/**
 * Basic Hook class. All other hooks should extend this and override either runHook or runFilter.
 * In short if you want result from the hook, override runFilter, otherwise runHook.
 * <p>
 * If the hook you are creating is supposed to have state, meaning that:<ul>
 * <li>It probably uses arguments in its constructor.
 * <li>Can potentially have instances that don't behave identically.
 * <li>Uses private members to store information between runs.
 * </ul>
 * Then you should also override methods equals and hashCode, so that they take into consideration any fields you have added.<p>
 * You can do so using the auto-generate feature from Eclipse: Source->Generate hashCode() and equals()
