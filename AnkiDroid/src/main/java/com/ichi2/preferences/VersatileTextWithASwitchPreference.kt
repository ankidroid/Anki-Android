/**
 * A combination of an EditTextPreference and a SwitchPreference.
 * It mostly looks like a SwitchPreference, but the switch and the title can be clicked separately.
 * If some text is set, it is possible to have the switch either of on off.
 * However, if text is null or empty, the switch can only be in the off state.
 *
 * The text value is stored with the key of the preference.
 * The key of the switch is suffixed with [SWITCH_SUFFIX].
 *
 * Notes on behavior:
 *   * If text is present, tapping on the switch toggles it.
 *   * If text is empty, tapping on the switch will open the dialog, as if the title was tapped.
 *   * If the dialog is closed with Cancel, no changes happen.
 *   * If the dialog is closed with Ok, and text is present, the switch will be set to on.
 *   * If the dialog is closed with Ok, and text is empty, the switch will be set to off.
 *
 * The preference inherits from [VersatileTextPreference] and supports any attributes it does,
 * including the regular [EditTextPreference] attributes.
