/**
 * The TaskManager has two related purposes.
 *
 * A concrete TaskManager's mission is to take a TaskDelegate, potentially a CollectionListener, and execute them.
 * Currently, the default TaskManager is SingleTaskManager, which executes the tasks in order in which they are generated. It essentially consists in using basicÂ AsyncTask properties with CollectionTask.
 * It should eventually be replaced by non deprecated system.
 *
 * The only other TaskManager currently is ForegroundTaskManager, which runs everything foreground and is used for unit testings.
 *
 * The class itself contains a static element which is the currently used TaskManager. Tasks can be executed on the current TaskManager with the static method launchTaskManager.
