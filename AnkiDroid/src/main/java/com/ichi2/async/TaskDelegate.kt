/**
 * TaskDelegate contains the business logic of background tasks.
 * While CollectionTask deals with all general task features, such as ensuring that no two tasks runs simultaneously
 * and Timberings, the Task contains the code that we actually want to execute.
 * <p>
 * TaskManager.launchCollectionTask takes a Task, and potentially a TaskListener. It is in charge of running
 * ensuring that the task is executed, by embedding this Task in an object that can actually be executed.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Currently, background processes uses CollectionTask, which inherits from AsyncTask, which is deprecated. Using this
 * delegation, we should hopefully eventually be able to stop using AsyncTask without making any change to the Task.
 * <p>
 * Tests can runs tasks in Foreground by changing the task manager. Those tasks can then be directly executed by
 * ForegroundTaskManager without needing an executor.
 * <p>
 * The Task type is used to cancel planified tasks. In particular it means that no Task should
 * be an anonymous class if we want to be able to cancel the task running it.
 *
 * @param <Progress> The type of values that the task can send to indicates its progress. E.g. a card to display while remaining work is done; the progression of a counter.
 * @param <Result>   The type of result returned by the task at the end. E.g. the tree of decks, counts for a particular deck
