/**
 * This interface defines a set of functions that are not available on all platforms.
 * <p>
 * A set of implementations for the supported platforms are available.
 * <p>
 * Each implementation ends with a {@code V<n>} prefix, identifying the minimum API version on which this implementation
 * can be used. For example, see {@link CompatV21}.
 * <p>
 * Each implementation {@code CompatVn} should extend the implementation {@code CompatVm} for the greatest m<n such that
 * {@code CompatVm} exists. E.g. as of July 2021 {@code CompatV23} extends {@code CompatV21} because there is no {@code CompatV22}.
 * If {@code CompatV22} were to be created one day, it will extends {@code CompatV22} and be extended by {@code CompatV23}.
 * <p>
 * Each method {@code method} must be implemented in the lowest Compat implementation (right now {@code CompatV21}, but
 * it will change when min sdk change). It must also be implemented in {@code CompatVn} if, in version {@code n} and higher,
 * a different implementation must be used. This can be done either because some method used in the API {@code n} got
 * deprecated, changed its behavior, or because the implementation of {@code method} can be more efficient.
 * <p>
 * When you call method {@code method} from some device with API {@code n}, it will uses the implementation in {@code CompatVm},
 * for {@code m < n} as great as possible. The value of {@code m} being at least the current min SDK. The method may be empty,
 * for example {@code setupNotificationChannel}'s implementation in {@code CompatV21} is empty since
 * notification channels were introduced in API 26.
 * <p>
 * Example: {@code CompatV26} extends {@code CompatV23} which extends {@code CompatV21}. The method {@code vibrate} is
 * defined in {@code CompatV21} where only the number of seconds of vibration is taken into consideration, and is
 * redefined in {@code CompatV26} - using {@code @Override} - where the style of vibration is also taken into
 * consideration. It meas that  on devices using APIs 21 to 25 included, the implementation of {@code CompatV21} is
 * used, and on devices using API 26 and higher, the implementation of {@code CompatV26} is used.
 * On the other hand a method like {@code setTime} that got defined in {@code CompatV21} and redefined in
 * {@code CompatV23} due to a change of API, need not be implemented again in CompatV26.
