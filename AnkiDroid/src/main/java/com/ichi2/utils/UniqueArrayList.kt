 * A collection of items that doesn't allow duplicate items, and allows fast random access, lookup, maintaining order, and sorting.

 * The [List] interface makes certain assumptions/requirements. This
 * implementation breaks these in certain ways, but this is merely the result of
 * rejecting duplicates. Each violation is explained in the method, but it
 * should not affect you.
 *
 * This class does also implement the [Set] interface, and as a result
 * you should bear in mind that Sets require immutable objects to function correctly.
 *
 * @implNote The implementation of this class extends [SetUniqueList] and adds the ability to define a comparator
 * to be used to judge uniqueness of elements, and allows sorting.
 *
 *
 * Data structures used internally:
 * - [ArrayList] to enable fast random access, sorting, and maintaining order of items during iteration
 * - [TreeSet] if a comparator is given or a [HashSet] otherwise.
