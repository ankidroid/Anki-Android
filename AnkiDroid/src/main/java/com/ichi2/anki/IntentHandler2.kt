/**
 * This activity serves as an intermediate handler to process various types of intents and forward them to the NoteEditor fragment hosted within the SingleFragmentActivity.
 *
 * The main reason for using this IntentHandler2 is to avoid conflicts in the manifest file. We can't have multiple
 * ACTION_SEND intents in same activity (IntentHandler) that only differ by their labels. By using this handler, we can manage these intents
 * and make sure they are sent to the NoteEditor correctly.
