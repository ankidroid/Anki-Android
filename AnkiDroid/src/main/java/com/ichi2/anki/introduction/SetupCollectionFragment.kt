/**
 * Allows a user multiple choices for setting up the collection:
 *
 * * Starting normally
 * * Syncing from AnkiWeb - this allows the user to log in and performs a sync when the DeckPicker is loaded
 *
 * This exists for two reasons:
 * 1) Ensuring that a user does not create two profiles: one for Anki Desktop and one for AnkiDroid
 * 2) Adds a screen that allows for 'advanced' setup.
 * for example: selecting a 'safe' folder using scoped storage, which would not have been deleted
 * if the app is uninstalled.
