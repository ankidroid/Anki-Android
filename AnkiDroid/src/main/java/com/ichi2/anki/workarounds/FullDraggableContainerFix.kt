/**
 * [FullDraggableContainer] is the thing that allows opening the navigation drawer
 * by swiping right anywhere on the screen.
 * It has an issue in that it will intercept all rightwards swipes,
 * even if a view inside it also wants these events. For instance,
 *
 *   * You can't swipe snackbars to the right to dismiss them, or
 *
 *   * You can't drag card browser search field cursor by dragging finger right across the field.
 *     (Dragging the finger left, and dragging the cursor *handle* right works, however.)
 *
 * The problem is twofold;
 *
 *   * The container does not listen for children asking it not to intercept touch, and
 *
 *   * The container eats up the motion events, not passing them to children in the first place.
 *
 * This solves the issue in the following way:
 *
 *   * When the container wants to intercept motion events, we skip *this one* interception event,
 *     allowing it to propagate to children.
 *
 *   * The child, which hopefully has a similar threshold for catching motion events,
 *     will capture the view, and request its parent to not intercept touch,
 *     which will propagate to us as well.
 *
 *   * We then skip all events until the child removes the request
 *     (it actually does not do that in practice),
 *     or when we receive another finger press, which signifies a new gesture.
 *
 * (It may seem that it would be possible to solve this by having a larger interception distance
 * on parent than on child. In practice, however, since the devices are slow and fingers are fast,
 * the interception usually happens on the second or the first motion event,
 * and finger travel distance is usually much higher than the usual threshold of about 8 dp.)
