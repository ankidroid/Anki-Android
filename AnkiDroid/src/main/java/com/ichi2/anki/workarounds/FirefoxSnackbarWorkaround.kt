/** #5374
 *
 * If a user attempts to open an apkg from the Firefox Snackbar, we just get a ACTION_VIEW on Reviewer...
 * It works if they click the download notification, but if they click "Open", then that disappears.
 *
 * So... tell them to go to about:downloads, or select the file from their file manager.
 * It sucks, but not much we can do.
 *
 * Reported as fixed in Firefox Preview
