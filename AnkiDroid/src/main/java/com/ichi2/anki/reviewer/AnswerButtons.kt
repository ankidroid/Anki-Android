     * In Review mode, hard uses a lower ease factor and reduces the ease by 15%
     *
     * ## Interpolation
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * * Steps of `[1, 1000]` give a hard interval of 500 minutes (8.3 hours)
     * * Steps of `[100]` give a hard interval of 150 minutes: (100 + (100 * 2))/2 - double the current step if there is only one step
     * * Steps of `[100, 50]` give a hard interval of 100 minutes: (100 + 100) / 2 - use the current step if it is larger than the next step
     * * * This leads to: `Again: 1.7, Hard: 2.5, Good: 1.7` - hard being greater than good
     * * * See: [Anki - Hard/good interval is longer than good/easy](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/hard-good-interval-longer-than-good-easy.html)
