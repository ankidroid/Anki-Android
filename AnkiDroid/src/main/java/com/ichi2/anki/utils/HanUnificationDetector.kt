/**
 * Detects Han Unification issues in note field content.
 *
 * Han Unification is a Unicode feature where visually distinct Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
 * characters are assigned the same code point. This can cause Japanese kanji to render as
 * Chinese hanzi (or vice versa) depending on the system font, unless the HTML explicitly
 * specifies the language via the `lang` attribute.
 *
 * Example: U+9AA8 (骨) renders differently in Japanese vs Chinese without lang="ja" or lang="zh"
 *
 * This detector is used during note creation/editing to warn users about potential rendering
 * issues before they encounter them during review.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification">Han Unification on Wikipedia</a>
