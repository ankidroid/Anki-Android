/**
 * Algorithm class which represents copying the essential files (collection and media SQL-related
 * files, and .nomedia/collection logs) to a location under scoped storage: [PRIORITY_FILES]
 * This exists as a class to allow overriding operations for fault injection testing
 *
 * Our main concerns here are ensuring that there are no errors, and the graceful handling of issues.
 * One primary concern is whether the failure case leaves files in the destination (scoped) directory.
 *
 * Many of our users are low on space, and leaving "difficult to delete" files in the app private
 * directory is user-hostile.
 *
 * See: [execute]
 *
 * Preconditions (verified inside [migrateEssentialFiles] and [execute] - exceptions thrown if not met):
 * * Collection is not corrupt and can be opened
 * * Collection basic check passes [UserActionRequiredException.CheckDatabaseException]
 * * Collection can be closed and locked
 * * User has space to mve files [UserActionRequiredException.OutOfSpaceException] (the size of essential files + [SAFETY_MARGIN_BYTES]
 * * A migration is not currently taking place
