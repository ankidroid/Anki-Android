 * This operation moves content of source to destination. This Operation is called one time for each file in the directory, and one last time. Unless an exception occurs.

 * @param [source]: an iterator over File content, [source] will be closed in [execute] once the source is empty or if accessing its content raise an exception.
 * @param [destination]: a directory to copy the source content.
 * This is different than [MoveFile], [MoveDirectory] and [MoveFileOrDirectory] where destination is the new path of the copied element.
 * Because in this case, there is not a single destination path.
