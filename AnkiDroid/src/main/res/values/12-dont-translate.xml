<!-- This contains strings that are used to test the translation process. They should not be used in actual code -->
<resources>
  <string
      name="crowdin_test_string_do_not_translate"
      >
    In order to ensure this string is not shown as untranslated, translate it the way you want. Probably using a single letter, so that it\'s quick. This string will never appear in ankidroid and is present here only to test crowdin feature.
