This contains strings that are used to test the translation process.
They should not be used in actual code.
Those strings still appear as untranslated to crowdin translators.

If you want to use a string in your code that can't be translated, please use:

* constants.xml if the string must be a constant, such as the name of someone or a URL
* hard coded string literals if the string should not be translated because it belongs to a feature in progress.
-->
<resources>
    <!--
    Adding or removing new line at the start/end of the string cause crowdin to require a new translation. Let's check if a comment before lead to a translation need!
    Adding this kind of XML comment does not cause the need for a new translation!
    -->
    <string name="crowdin_second_string_to_test" comment="Changing the order of the strings didn't cause a need for a new translation. Let's add this comment; if it's not removed it means the comment didn't cause a requirement for a new translation!">
        This will be used to check that changing the order of strings does not require translation.
